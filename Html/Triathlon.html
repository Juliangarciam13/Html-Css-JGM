            <h2>Â¿What Is a Triathlon?</h2>
               <p>
                  A triathlon is a type of multisport race that involves swimming, biking, and running across long distances. <br>
                  A triathlon race is typically one continuous event with only short breaks in between each activity to allow <br>
                  the athletes time to prepare for the next portion of the triathlon race. Many triathletes wear tri-suits which <br>
                  prevent the need to change outfits between events. The competitors begin with an open-water swim or pool swim. <br>
                  Then, competitors have a short opportunity to change out of their wetsuits or swim caps, put on cycling shoes, <br>
                  and get onto their triathlon bikes. The next portion of the race is a bike ride, taking place either on an off-road <br>
                  course or on city streets. Then the cyclists transition into running shoes to cross the finish line during the running <br>
                  portion of the event. <br>

            <h2>6 Popular Triathlon Distances</h2>
                <p>
                  Triathlon distances vary based on the event organizer and age group, and race distances are often subject to change. <br>
                  Modified triathlons use different combinations of distance events, such as the aquathlon (running and swimming), 
                  the aquabike (swimming and biking), and the duathlon (running, biking, and then running again). <br>
